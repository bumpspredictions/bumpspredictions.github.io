  <h1>Daily predictions</h1>
  <p>Here we lay out our one day ahead predictions for the next day’s racing. The basis is our overall estimates of crew speeds, but they’re adjusted based on previous days’ performances. For example, if a crew has gone up more than we’d expect, we’ll adjust our prediction to reflect that. We don’t incorporate additional information beyond the results, for example crashes.</p>
  <p>Please note that the methodology behind these predictions is lower quality than our overall estimates, so take them with an even larger pinch of salt. The predictions on the boundaries of decisions will not always align, as each division is modelled independently here.</p>
  <div id="thursday" class="section level2">
  <h2>Thursday</h2>
  <p>Please note that the W2 division predictions for this day are especially uncertain, and should be viewed with extreme caution.</p>

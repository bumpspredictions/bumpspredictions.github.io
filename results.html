  <p>The column “adjusted split” adjusts the raw time for the event and division’s conditions and length, allowing finish times to be compared between different events and divisions. As the adjustments for the conditions are estimated, there is uncertainty in the adjusted split. The “80% CI” gives the range of values that we are 80% sure the true value lies within<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

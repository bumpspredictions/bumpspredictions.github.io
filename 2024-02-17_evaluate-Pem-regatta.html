  <p>Top 10 are a bit above the rest on how surprising. These matchups were (with winner bolded, grouped by event).</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Clare W1 v <strong>Catz W1</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Catz W1</strong> v Emma W1</li>
  <li><strong>Corpus W1</strong> v Jesus W2</li>
  <li>Emma W2 v <strong>Hughes W1</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Clare W2</strong> v Maggie W2</li>
  <li><strong>Wolfson M1</strong> v Corpus M1</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why did we underestimate Catz? Lets compare their race results to Clare and Emma.</p>
